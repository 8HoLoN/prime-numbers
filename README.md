# prime-numbers
Prime numbers sets as mathematical sequence based on sine products.

# Introduction
I have never seen prime numbers expressed/defined this way, so I decided to write it down here. This definition doesn't use square root function but sine function, so it's surely not the best for digital computation but it might be for analog computation based on ocillators.

# Formulae
* With 1 element in the first set (but less elegant with ν1 definition).

* With 2 elements in the first set (more elegant with an unique ν function definition).
